# Dracarys

**Version 1.0.0**

A 2D shoot 'em up game made in Scratch. The game is limited to one player, which is Daenerys Targaryen from the TV series "Game of Thrones." 
The idea of the game is to shoot all other characters running around below you, via your fire breathing dragon. Winning the game is achieved by killing all characters.

The game controls (keyboard) are simple:<br>
- Left and right arrow keys to move left and right, respectively.<br>
- Space bar to shoot.
